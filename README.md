# SML
The code of our [paper](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.300/) is basically based on the publicly available toolkit: THUMT-Tensorflow[1] (python version 3.6). Please refer to it in Github for the required dependency. (Just seach it on Github.)

The following steps are training our model and then test its performance in terms of BLEU, TER, and Sentence Similarity (Still updating).

Take En->De as an example
# Training

Our work involves three-stage training
## The first stage
```
1) bash first_step_ende.sh # set the training_step=100,000; Suppose the generated checkpoint file is located in path1
```

## The second stage (i.e., fine-tuning on the in-domain chat translation data)

Now, the in-domain chat translation database can be downloaded here to facilitate subsequent research [ENZH](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Hf4Bs_nh3xN-1wzZk8eahWzJ8CLdDqDd?usp=sharing) and [ENDE](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Jk03qjOnLuTND85GlEmL8bobiMWnwpAg?usp=sharing). Note that the copyright of the aligned subtitle database belongs to [kexiaoguo](https://www.kexiaoguo.com/) and it can be used ONLY for non-commercial purposes.

```
2) bash second_step_ende.sh # Here, set the training_step=1; Suppose the generated checkpoint file is located in path2
3) python thumt1_code/thumt/scripts/combine_add.py --model path2 --part path1 --output path3  # copy the weight of the first stage to the second stage.
4) bash second_step_ende.sh # Here, set the --output=path3 and the training_step=200,000; Suppose the generated checkpoint file is path4
```

## The third stage (i.e., fine-tuning on the target chat translation data)
```
5) bash third_step_ende.sh # Here, set the training_step=1; Suppose the generated checkpoint file is located in path5
6) python thumt1_code/thumt/scripts/combine_add.py --model path4 --part path5 --output path6  # copy the weight of the first stage to the second stage.
7) bash third_step_ende.sh # Here, set the --output=path6 and the training_step=205,000; Suppose the generated checkpoint file is path7
```

# Test by multi-blue.perl
```
8) bash test_en_de2.sh # set the checkpoint file path to path7 in this script. # Suppose the predicted file is located in path8 at checkpoint step xxxxx
```

# Test by SacreBLEU and TER
Required TER: v0.7.25; Sacre-BLEU: version.1.4.13 (BLEU+case.mixed+numrefs.1+smooth.exp+tok.13a+version.1.4.13)
```
9) python SacreBLEU_TER_Coherence_Evaluation_code/cal_bleu_ter4ende.py # Please correctly set the golden file and predicted file in this file and in sacrebleu_ende.py, respectively.
```
